# Odin on Embedded Systems

This is a starter project for running the  Odin Programming Language on an ARM Cortex M3 using the Zephyr RTOS. These endeavours are based on previous work by https://github.com/tangybbq/non-c-on-zephyr.

This project uses a custom version of Odin and as such compiling will not work with standard Odin. The custom version will be released soon.
